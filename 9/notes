Conditional Branching
JXX - JA, JAE, JE, JG, JZ, JNZ ... etc
Dictated by the state of the:
- Zero Flag (ZF)
- Parity Flag (PF)
- Overflow Flag (OF)
- Sign Flag (SF)
- Carry Flag (CF)
In order to use conditinal jumps, you must haev an operation which sets the EFLAGS register appropriately
In conditional jumps, only SHORT and NEAR jumps are supported.  Far jumps are not supported

Loop instruction
used to loop through a set of instructions a pre-determined number of times
number of times is stored in ECX
-- Loop automatically decrements ECX after every run
-- Sample:
	<code>
	movl $10, %ecx  # 10 times
	LoopThis:
		<code>
		<code>
		LOOP LoopThis
There are also LOOPZ and LOOPNZ associated with Zero Flag
