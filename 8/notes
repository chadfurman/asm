Unconditional branching
1. JMP
	-- compare it with GOTO
	-- Syntax -- jmp label
		-- short +/- 128bytes
		-- far to different segment
		-- near between short/near
2. Call:
	Just like calling a function in c
	syntax: call location
	there is an associated RET statement with every call
		compare with return statement in C -- similar
	Using call pushes the next instruction address onto stack
