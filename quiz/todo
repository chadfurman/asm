1) make a function which copys a string from initialized memory to uninitalized memory
2) make a function which asks the user for a string
3) make a function which loops through other function calls

Note: I should initialize a "prompt" in memory
-- We are copying the string just because we want to practice string copying
-- It doesn't matter how many times you loop the function call
-- If the user doesn't enter a string, show an error and ask again
